Comparative Genomic Analysis of Listeria monocytogenes Isolates from the South African Polony Outbreak (2017–2018)
1. Introduction and Objectives
This report details the bioinformatics analysis of 50 Listeria monocytogenes isolates, a subset of the strains responsible for the devastating 2017–2018 South African listeriosis outbreak. The project utilizes Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) data to genetically characterize the pathogen, which is crucial for informing public health response and clinical guidance.

The objectives are:

Confirm the Organism Identity

Determine the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Profile

Detect Virulence (Toxin) Genes

Suggest Evidence-Based Treatment Options
