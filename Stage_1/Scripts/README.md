## Comparative Genomic Analysis of Listeria monocytogenes Isolates from the South African Polony Outbreak (2017–2018)
# 1. Introduction and Objectives
This report details the bioinformatics analysis of 50 Listeria monocytogenes isolates, a subset of the strains responsible for the devastating 2017–2018 South African listeriosis outbreak. The project utilizes Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) data to genetically characterize the pathogen, which is crucial for informing public health response and clinical guidance.

## The objectives are:
a. Confirm the Organism Identity

b. Determine the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Profile

c. Detect Virulence (Toxin) Genes

d. Suggest Evidence-Based Treatment Options

# 2. Methodology: WGS Pipeline Overview
The analysis follows a comprehensive microbial WGS pipeline, structured into four main phases using a suite of bioinformatics tools and custom Bash/Python scripts.
